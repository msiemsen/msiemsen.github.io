### Course Description

We will be making a traditional double screw vise as shown in Randal Holme and Moxon. Also a mallet, a marking gauge, and a marking knife. You will use hand tools to make these four very useful items for your shop and gain the ability to make more of them as needed. Hand chopped mortises, boring with a brace and bit, threading with a screwbox and tap are all covered. We will do a bit of metal work on the marking knife, grinding and filing the blade to shape then hardening and tempering the steel. The tools alone are worth the cost of the class!

On the first day we will learn to lay out and cut several basic woodworking joints. We will cut mortise and tenon and bridle joints. Learning to layout joints, saw straight, cut to the line and chop and pare with a chisel to your mark. Working our way up to dovetails on day two. We will also cover wood movement and why joints are made the way they are.

Whether for drawers or case work dovetails are actually pretty basic woodworking. At first it can be a bit difficult to keep it all straight. Pins first? Tails first? What's a pin or tail? Which piece is the waste? What's a half pin? How do you keep the pieces organized? It will all become clear as you learn to layout, saw and chop this signature woodworking joint. We will do through and half-blind joints, then make a box! Bring the tools you have. I have some I can loan you.

**Tools Needed:**

* Dovetail saw (for small joints)
* Carcass saw (for casework joints)
* Sharp Chisels

  ### Course description

  Most people have never used a properly sharpened handsaw so they don't realize how well they work. Find out what you are missing! In the morning Mike will demonstrate how to bring an old saw back to life. We will go over what to look for in a handsaw and how to sharpen a saw. We will supply files and vises. Bring a saw to sharpen, between 10 and 6 points per inch and a saw vise if you have one. If you don't have a saw that you want to practice on Mike has some practice saws. He also has a few saws for sale. On day two we will use our saws to make a sawbench/sawhorse.

  **Tools**

  Bring a 10 to 6 point saw that needs to be sharpened and a saw vise if you have one, an 8 point saw is best. If you don't have a saw you want to practice on Mike has some practice saws. You can bring extra saws for evaluation. Many students bring an 8 point crosscut saw and a 5 or 5 1/2 point ripsaw and sharpen them both!
