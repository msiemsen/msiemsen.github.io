* [mike@schoolofwood.com](mailto:mike@schoolofwood.com "email")

**A gateway skills class**

### Course Description

Getting your edge tools sharp is probably the most important skill a woodworker can learn. Sharpening should be a quick and easy task. On day one Mike will show you what it takes to obtain and maintain a good sharp edge. We will discuss various sharpening systems as well as different bevel angles and why they are used. You will also get ideas for setting up a sharpening station in your shop. Our goal is for you to achieve the 5 minute edge, the time it takes to remove and sharpen a plane iron, replace it, and get back to work. We will also sharpen and learn to use the card scraper.

On day two we will cover chisel use as well as what it takes to make a plane work properly, whether you are flattening a board and removing lots of material, jointing an edge, or smoothing for a finished surface. We will discuss when an iron needs camber and when an iron should be straight, and the nuances in between. You will learn what to look for in a plane, and what to avoid and how to correct deficiencies in your planes. We will flatten plane soles, adjust frogs and make your planes sing! As time allows we will go over specialty planes like plows, tongue and groove, combination, and profile.

**Tools**

* Bring your planes and chisels and scrapers to work on and your sharpening stones for assessment. I will have sharpening stations set up for your use. If you don't have a plane to tune up I have several for sale at reasonable prices.

* [mike@schoolofwood.com](mailto:mike@schoolofwood.com)

**Course Description**

On the first day we will learn to lay out and cut several basic woodworking joints. We will cut mortise and tenon and bridle joints. Learning to layout joints, saw straight, cut to the line and chop and pare with a chisel to your mark. Working our way up to dovetails on day two. We will also cover wood movement and why joints are made the way they are.

Whether for drawers or case work dovetails are actually pretty basic woodworking. At first it can be a bit difficult to keep it all straight. Pins first? Tails first? What's a pin or tail? Which piece is the waste? What's a half pin? How do you keep the pieces organized? It will all become clear as you learn to layout, saw and chop this signature woodworking joint. We will do through and half-blind joints, then make a box! Bring the tools you have. I have some I can loan you.

**Tools Needed:**

* Dovetail saw (for small joints)
* Carcass saw (for casework joints)
* Sharp Chisels
* Mallet
* Marking Gauge
* Marking Knife

**A gateway skills class**

### Course description

Most people have never used a properly sharpened handsaw so they don't realize how well they work. Find out what you are missing! Learn how to bring an old saw back to life. We will go over what to look for in a handsaw, how to clean up and how to sharpen a saw. We will supply files and vises. Bring a saw to sharpen, between 10 and 6 points per inch and a saw vise if you have one. If you don't have a saw that you want to practice on Mike has some practice saws. He also has a few saws for sale. In the afternoon we will also take a minute to file an auger bit.

Day two will be spent sharpening our sawing skills while building a sawbench, a much needed appliance for sawing. Learn how to properly rip and crosscut. How to saw to a line and how to position your body for square and angled cuts.

**Tools**

Bring a 10 to 6 point saw that needs to be sharpened and a saw vise if you have one, an 8 point saw is best. If you don't have a saw you want to practice on Mike has some practice saws. You can bring extra saws for evaluation. Many students bring an 8 point crosscut saw and a 5 or 5 1/2 point ripsaw and sharpen them both! Some find that magnifiers help.
