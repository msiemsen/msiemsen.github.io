**A gateway skills class**

### Course Description

Getting your tools sharp is possibly the most important skill a woodworker can learn. Sharpening should be a quick and easy task. Mike will show you what it takes to obtain and maintain a good sharp edge. We will discuss various sharpening systems as well as different bevel angles and why they are used. You will also get ideas for setting up a sharpening station in your shop. Our goal is for you to achieve the 5 minute edge, the time it takes to remove and sharpen a plane iron, replace it, and get back to work. You will also learn what it takes to make a plane work properly, whether you are flattening a board and removing lots of material, jointing an edge, or smoothing for a finished surface. We will discuss when an iron needs camber and when an iron should be straight, and the nuances in between. You will learn what to look for in a plane, and what to avoid and how to correct deficiencies in your planes. We will flatten plane soles, adjust frogs and make your planes sing!

**Tools**

* Bring your planes and chisels and scrapers to work on and your sharpening stones for assessment. I will have sharpening stations set up for your use.

**A gateway skills class**

**Course description**

Most people have never used a properly sharpened handsaw so they don't realize how well they work. Find out what you are missing! In the morning Mike will demonstrate how to bring an old saw back to life. We will go over what to look for in a handsaw and how to sharpen a saw. We will supply files and vises. Bring a saw to sharpen, between 10 and 6 points per inch and a saw vise if you have one. If you don't have a saw that you want to practice on Mike has some practice saws. He sometimes has a few saws for sale. In the afternoon we will also file an auger bit.

**Tools**

Bring a 10 to 6 point saw that needs to be sharpened and a saw vise if you have one, an 8 point saw is best. If you don't have a saw you want to practice on Mike has some practice saws. You can bring extra saws for evaluation. Many students bring an 8 point crosscut saw and a 5 or 5 1/2 point ripsaw and sharpen them both!
