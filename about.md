# Hand tool shop classes

### Please be vaccinated before registering to take a class.

Registration for all classes is now open. Sign up now to ensure yourself a place.

My shop is located on a quiet rural setting in Minnesota, just 35 miles North of Minneapolis/Saint Paul. The shop has wood floors, is heated and has air conditioning. Class size will be a maximum of 8 people so students are assured of getting enough time with the instructor. The shop will open 30 minutes before the start of your classes, try to arrive at least 15 minutes early to take care of payment, paperwork and introductions. On the first day you will select a bench which will have your materials for your project on it. Materials preparation is typically done ahead of time for you so we can get started right away. During the course of the class I will try to find out what tools and equipment you have at home so you can better use what you have or focus on what you want to acquire. You will work at your own speed.  We will cover safety practices in the shop and for the machines we use. Beverages will be available throughout the day. A tasty cold cut lunch will be provided at 12:00. You may work quietly with hand tools during the lunch break. Classes will resume at 1:00.  My goal is to provide a relaxed learning environment where you can have fun, make new friends and develop new skills. Let us know if you have any special needs.

# About Mike

![](/uploads/dsc_0017.JPG)

I am a life long woodworker; I learned by trial and error, reading, on the job training and taking classes. I believe that the best way to develop your skills as a woodworker is to immerse yourself in the craft with skilled people to guide you along the way. I am thankful to the many people who shared their skills and knowledge with me. I have a B.S. degree in Industrial Education; I have worked as a house carpenter and in millwork and fixture shops, run my own cabinet and furniture shop, and worked as a restoration furniture maker on 18th century American furniture. I have a video out with Lost Art Press called "The Naked Woodworker" about getting started in woodworking with nothing. I also have a video at Craftsy.com called Woodworking Essentials, Benches and Boxes and a popular video on youtube about viseless workholding. I am pleased to offer these classes as a way to pass along my knowledge and love of the craft of woodworking. Any suggestions you might have for curriculum or visiting instructors would be very helpful. Help me make this a great school. 

Thanks, Mike
